# Personal Health Coach
Final project: <b>AI idea</b> for the course <i>Building AI - Elements of AI</i>

## Summary 

The <b>Personal Health Coach</b> is an intelligent assistant that helps users maintain and enhance their health by analyzing daily activities, diet, sleep patterns, and fitness routines. It offers personalized recommendations and insights, helping everyone from beginners to athletes achieve their health goals.

## Background
Maintaining a healthy lifestyle involves balancing multiple aspects of daily life, including diet, exercise, and mental well-being. People face challenges like:

	•	Limited access to personalized advice tailored to their unique needs and preferences

Personal Health Coach addresses these challenges by:

	•	Offering real-time, personalized health recommendations based on users’ data
	•	Providing structured and adaptive training programs for athletes and enthusiasts
	•	Helping users set and achieve health(y) goals
	•	Providing early warnings about potential health risks based on predictive analytics

 ## How is it used?
The Personal Health Coach is integrated into a mobile app that users can install on their devices. The app syncs with users health devices (like smartwatches, fitness trackers, and other health apps) to gather data on their daily activities, exercises, diet, and sleep patterns.

## What's next?
In order to make The Personal Health Coach a plattform, following needs to happen:
1. Integrations: Intergrate with health apps, wellness devices, 3rd party apps, and services.
2. Predictive models: Develop models to detect early signs on health issues.
3. Recommendations: Develop models capable of creating personalised training plans based on goals, and preferences. The models shoudl also be able to refocus based on user activities, and other health metrics.
4. Chat: Develop NLP model that has the capability to onboard users, motivate users, and discuss their individual health and goals.
